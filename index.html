  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong><a href="#">Implemented blog website</a></strong></td>
      <td>Feb.2019</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li>
      • Improved me skill about using Express.js with Node.js to run a server on local computer which can serve <br>
      a blog website for people writing daily things on it.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Used Body-Parser and Ejs to exchange information between website and server and took advantage of CSS <br>
      with bootstrap to design the Ejs documents make website look beautiful and powerful
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="#">Applied Naïve Bayes algorithm to classify articles</a></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      • Created a dictionary to save words in articles and transformed words of articles to vectors via using bag of <br>
      words method to make feature extracted from article can be feed into algorithm
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Tapped into Naïve Bayes algorithm with Laplace smoothing which add noise to algorithm to avoid zero results <br>
      to classify different type of articles in order to mine information hidden in articles.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • We achieve nearly 100% accuracy of algorithm implemented by comparing predicted results with real results.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="#">Implemented an online Simon game</a></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      • Used HTML to construct a website framework for a Simon game and Designed website style in pixel style via <br>
      using CSS and bootstrap to make website more attractive and make me more creative during the design period
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Took advantage of Javascript and jQuery to achieve the function of Simon game which make me more familiar with <br>
      online debugging
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="#">Applied deep learning to predict time series data</a></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      • Used python to write a program to process data which can improve convergence rate by 8% by removing the <br>
      data which is equal to zero and normalizing data.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Avoided over fitting by using dropout method that dropped out hidden and visible layer in neural network <br>
      randomly and use ReLU activation function to avoid gradient disappearance.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Built a LSTM neural network model to predict time series data which achieves 84% prediction accuracy.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="#">Use convolutional neural network in numerical recognition</a></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      • Took advantage of TensorFlow framework to build up a convolutional neural network which achieve 99.2% <br>
      accuracy on numerical recognition.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Used pooling layers to avoid overfitting and make the size of images so small that to reduce computation <br>
      work and lighten the burden of computers.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Used Softmax function to map-normalized output to a probability distribution over predicted output class <br>
      which turn integer results into decimal in order to make results more practical.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      • Tapped into cross entropy function to reflect the probability distribution over real value and predicted value.
    </li>
  </ul>
